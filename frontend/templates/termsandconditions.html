                <h2 class="mb-0 leading-7 font-semibold text-gray-900 text-2xl tracking-tight">Fair Use Policy.</h2>
                <p class="mb-0  ml-2 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">Caly’s Fair Use Policy builds on existing use restrictions and helps us ensure that the services can be used fairly by every customer. Certain Caly features, like notifications, may be aggregated and collectively sent from fewer email addresses or phone numbers. This means those features are used concurrently by a number of customers. If a single customer places disproportionately high demands on the services, it may adversely affect the Caly experience for other users. The vast majority of our customers use the service considerately and their usage levels don't adversely impact service capacity. However, even the activity of a small number of customers who use the service inappropriately has the potential to significantly impact the service for other customers.
                    Customers’ usage of certain features like SMS notification is continuously monitored. Where a customer generates an exceptionally high load over a short period of time, Caly reserves the right to restrict usage, suspend access, or charge fees for excess usage in order to protect Caly’s platform and other customers’ usage. Only customers that consistently generate an exceptionally high load over a sustained period of time will be affected by this policy.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mb-0 leading-7 font-semibold text-gray-900 text-2xl tracking-tight">Warranty Disclaimer.</h2>

                    This limitation of liability applies to all claims of liability, even if Caly was informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if other remedies fail their essential purpose.
